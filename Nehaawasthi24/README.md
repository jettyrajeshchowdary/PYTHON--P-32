# TIC_TAC_TOE

### I Try to Code the game which we all play in our childhood i.e. TIC_TAC_TOE

So  I coded the program in such a way as the block is distributed like a NUMPAD lock of your keyboard.

After running my Code in Python IDLE ,the Idle shell shows the following response 

Firstly it will ask for the value of X

Suppose if I gave the value of X as 1 from NUMPAD it will be replace by X for the respective position

Now it will ask for the value of O ,suppose I choose 6 for represeting o in the game then,

Again if I gave 4 as X then,

now giving 9 as O

again giving the value of X as 7

So it seems like X won the match easily .

The winner is mentioned seperatly ,with a option for rematch
